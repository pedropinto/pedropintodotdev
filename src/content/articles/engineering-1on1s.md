One-on-ones are the highest leverage meeting in an engineering organization.

My format is simple:
- 10 minutes on energy and context
- 20 minutes on blockers and decisions
- 10 minutes on growth and feedback

The goal is not to solve everything live. The goal is to surface what matters and create momentum.
