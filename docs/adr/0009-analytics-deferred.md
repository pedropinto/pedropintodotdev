# 0009 - Analytics Deferred
- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-21

## Context
Analytics was discussed (`article_click`, `article_view`, `article_engaged`) but adds external-provider and privacy decisions.

## Decision
Defer analytics implementation for now.

## Consequences
- Faster delivery of core product.
- No behavior tracking until revisited.
- Future ADR needed when selecting provider and event schema.
