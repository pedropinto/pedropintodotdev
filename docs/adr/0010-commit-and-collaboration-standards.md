# 0010 - Commit and Collaboration Standards
- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-21

## Context
Project changes should be easy to review, cherry-pick, and roll back.

## Decision
Use small, incremental commits and frequent pushes, with commit messages in this style:
- `Added ... to ...`
- `Removed ...`
- `Updated ...`

## Consequences
- Cleaner history and safer iteration.
- Easier collaboration with humans and agents.
- Requires discipline to avoid bundling unrelated changes.
