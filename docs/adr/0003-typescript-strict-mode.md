# 0003 - TypeScript Strict Mode
- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-21

## Context
As content and routes grow, runtime mistakes become more expensive.

## Decision
Use TypeScript with strict settings for config, utilities, and content typing.

## Consequences
- Better safety and refactor confidence.
- Slightly more upfront typing work.
- Fewer silent data-shape regressions.
