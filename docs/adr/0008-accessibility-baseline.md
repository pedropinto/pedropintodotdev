# 0008 - Accessibility Baseline
- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-02-21

## Context
The blog should be readable and usable by default across devices and assistive technologies.

## Decision
Apply baseline accessibility rules:
- semantic structure,
- clear focus/interaction affordances,
- descriptive alt text without redundant wording,
- contrast-conscious token usage.

## Consequences
- Better usability and quality consistency.
- Fewer late accessibility fixes.
- Requires periodic accessibility checks as UI evolves.
